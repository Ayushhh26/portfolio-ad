      "Designed an AI-driven bot navigation system for a dynamic 40x40 grid with evolving fire spread. Simulated four bot strategies, achieving an 85% success rate across 1000+ trials. Integrated a fire propagation model with adjustable flammability, reducing failure rates by 20%. Optimized real-time pathfinding using probabilistic modeling, cutting navigation time by 25% while enhancing escape efficiency.",
